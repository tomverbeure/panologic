## Introduction

The project log can be found [here](https://hackaday.io/project/136227-panologic-zero-client-g1).

This project starts with the work of The Cranky Sysadmin, and will build on top of that:

 * There exists [a low profile version of the Pano Logic G1](https://twitter.com/zephray_wenting/status/1751276911844557238)
   which seems to behave the same as the regular cube. 

## Main Board

## FPGA Connections

The pin constraint file can be found [here](shared/top.ucf).

## JTAG Connector

6 pin connector J8 is the JTAG connector. When the IO connectors are at the bottom, J8 is located
at the top left of the Xilinx chip, and pin 1 is the one on the left.

The pin order does NOT follow the one of my Digilent clone.

Pinout is as follows:

1. VCC
2. TDI
3. TMS
4. TDO
5. TCK
6. GND

## SPI Connector

1. GND
2. CS#
3. DQ1 (MISO)
4. CLK
5. DQ0 (MOSI)
6. VCC

The SPI pins are used to configure the bitstream at power-up. After that, they become user IO.

To program the SPI, use the "Short to Program" jumper and attach SPI programmer to the connector. The
"Short to Program" jumper pulls the PROG\_B pin of the FPGA to ground, which forces all FPGA IOs into
Hi-Z.

During development, since the JTAG is already connected anyway, it's easier to program the SPI flash through
JTAG.

The procedure is simply: Using Impact, create an 'mcs' file that contains the bitstream in SPI programming format. Then use Impact
to program that file into the SPI flash through JTAG.

    Hi-Speed Universal Serial Bus host controller for embedded applications with built-in 3-port HUB. However, for some reason
    there is a separate 3-port HUB on the board, so I assume that only one port is used. (Why?)

    Serial Flash Embedded Memory, 8Mbit.

    A non-compressed XC3S1600E bitstream needs 5,969,696 bits ([UG332](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/user_guides/ug332.pdf), Table 1-4),
    which leaves ~2Mbit (512KByte) free for other uses.

    It should be possible to replace the M25P80 with a larger version, such as the 16Mbit M25P16. These parts are end-of-life and not available
    anymore on Mouser or Digikey, but [Adesto Tech](http://www.adestotech.com/wp-content/uploads/M25P-SERIES-CONVERSION-GUIDE-08_14_1.pdf) makes
    compatible replacements.

* [TI THS8135](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ths8135.pdf)

    10-BIT 240-MSPS VIDEO DAC

    Chip operates in general DAC mode. No analog SYNC pulses are generated because HSYNC and VSYNC are separate digital signals for VGA.

* [Micron Mobile Low-Power DDR SDRAM MT46H8M32LFB5-6](https://www.micron.com/~/media/documents/products/data-sheet/dram/mobile-dram/low-power-dram/lpddr/30-series/t36n_256mb_mobile_lpddr_sdram.pdf)

    [Product page](https://www.micron.com/parts/dram/mobile-ddr-sdram/mt46h8m32lfb5-6)

    Chip has 'D9FSD' marker, which is the FPBA code for MT46H8M32LFB5-6:A.

    2 Meg x 32 x 4 Banks = 8M x 32-bits or 32MByte.

    166MHz clock. Max BW: 2 x 166 x 32 = 10.6 Gbit/s or 1.32 GByte/s. (24bpp 1080p@60 ~ 3Gbps)

    The Xilinx ISE MIG tool only supports 8x and 16x regular DDR, not 32x LPDDR. So it looks like a custom DDR controller must be used for that?

    Information regarding DDR has been gathered [here](DDR.md).

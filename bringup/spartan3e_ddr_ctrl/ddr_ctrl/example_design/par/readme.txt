This folder has the batch files to synthesize using the XST or Synplify Pro and
PAR the design through command mode.

Steps to run the design using the ise_flow (batch mode):

1. Executing the ise_flow.bat file, synthesizes the design using XST or
   Synplify Pro and does the PAR.
   On running "ise_flow.bat" file, removes the XST/Synplify Pro report
   files first (if exist any on previous runs) and then does
   implementation of the design.

2. On running the ise_flow.bat file, creates the all report files.

Steps to run the design using the create_ise (GUI mode - for XST cases only):

1. This file will appear for XST cases only.

2. On executing the "create_ise.bat" file creates "test.xise" project file
   and set all the properties of the design selected.

3. The design can be implemented in ISE Projnav GUI by invoking
   the "test.xise" project file.

4. In Linux operating systems, test.xise project can be invoked by executing
   the command 'ise test.xise' from the terminal.

About other files in PAR folder :

* ddr_ctrl.ucf file is the constraint file for the design. This is used by
  ISE tool during PAR phase. It has all the clock constraints,
  Location constraints, false paths if any, IO standards and
  Area group constraints if any.

* ise_run.txt file has synthesis options for the XST tool.
  This file is used for batch mode.

* mem_interface_top.ut file has the options for the Configuration file
  generation i.e. the .bit file.

* "rem_files.bat" file has all the file names of the report files that are
  generated by ISE/Synplify Pro.

* "set_ise_prop.tcl" file has all the properties that needs to be set
  in GUI mode. This file will appear only for XST cases.

* "icon_coregen.xco", "ila_coregen.xco" and "vio_coregen.xco" files are
  used to generate ChipScope ila and icon EDIF/NGC files. When you want to
  view the design signals on ChipScope, you should port the design signals to
  ChipScope modules i.e., ila and icon in the ddr_ctrl rtl file.
  In order to generate the EDIF/NGC files, you must execute the following
  commands before starting synthesis and PAR.

        coregen -b icon_coregen.xco
        coregen -b ila_coregen.xco
        coregen -b vio_coregen.xco

Note : When you generate the design using "Debug Signals for Memory Controller"
       option Enable, the above mentioned ChipScope coregen commands are printed
       into ise_flow.bat and create_ise.bat files. The ddr_ctrl rtl file
       will have the design debug signals portmapped to vio and icon
       ChipScope modules.

* At the start of a Chip Scope Analyzer project, all of the signals in
  every core have generic names. "ddr_ctrl.cdc" is a file that contains
  all the signal names of all cores. Upon importing this file, signal names are
  renamed to the specified names in "ddr_ctrl.cdc" file. This file will work
  for the generated designs from MIG. If any of the design parameter values
  are changed after generating the design, this file will not work.

Synth folder:

* Synth folder has the constraint file for synplify Pro designs
  i.e. the .sdc file, Project file which has the design files to be added to
  the project i.e. the .prj file  and the synthesis tool options file for
  synplify Pro i.e. .tcl file.

compatible_ucf folder:

* MIG outputs this folder only when Pin Compatible FPGAs are checked in GUI
  (Pin Compatible FPGAs page in GUI). It generates the UCF files for all
  the Compatible FPGAs selected in GUI. If you want to switch to any of the
  Compatible FPGAs follow the steps mentioned below.

* For example, the design is generated with component name as ddr_ctrl with
  Target FPGA 4000FG1156 and Compatible FPGA 5000FG1156.

   - Change the FPGA name to 5000FG1156 from 4000FG1156 in ise_flow.bat,
     create_ise.bat and ise_run.txt, set_ise_prop.tcl in par folder and
     .tcl file in synth folder.
   - Paste the 5000FG1156.ucf file in par folder.
   - Change the UCF file name in batch file to the one in compatible_ucf
     folder i.e., change the UCF name (ddr_ctrl.ucf) in ise_flow.bat and
     create_ise.bat file to XC3S4000_FG1156.ucf.

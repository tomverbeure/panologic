Evaluation of the PERIOD and MAXDELAY constraints by the static timing analyzer is not sufficient to determine if the memory interface is functional at a particular frequency.
The PERIOD constraint covers the internal timing between synchronous elements, and the MAXDELAY constraints cover portions of the critical paths.
This spreadsheet covers the concept of timing budgets for the interface between the FPGA and memory device.

Most timing data used in this sheet is obtained from the device data sheets. Additional data is obtained from ISE tool. 
The board layout skew between signals in each group (data and strobe) is assumed to be 50ps or less,
 which is realistic amount in a point-to-point connection.
